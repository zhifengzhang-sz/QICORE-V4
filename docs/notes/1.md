# Questions

## 1. Package Selection Visibility Problem

**Context**: 
- We have language-agnostic implementation guide: `docs/guides/impl.prompt.md`
- Language-specific guides that depend on package research:
  - `impl.ts.prompt.md` → uses `build/package/ts.md`
- `impl.py.prompt.md` → uses `build/package/py.md`

**Issue**: Package selection is the **most critical step** in the implementation stage, but this importance is not clearly communicated in our current documentation structure.

**Specific Questions**:
- Where in the documentation flow should we explicitly highlight the package selection step?
- Should we create a dedicated "Package Research Stage" between Design and Implementation?
- How can we make it clear that implementation quality directly depends on package selection quality?

## 2. Mathematical Model Contract Layer

**Context**: 
- Current flow: `sources/nl + sources/guides/formal.prompt.md → build/objective/formal.spec.md`
- The formal spec explicitly identifies and defines mathematical models (Monad, Functor, etc.)
- What's implicit: these models form a reusable interface contract layer
- This implicit contract layer is not currently extracted as a separate, reusable artifact

**Proposal**: Extract and formalize the **Mathematical Model Contract Layer** that:
- Serves as reusable interface contracts between formal spec and design stages
- Provides abstract mathematical structures as base contracts (e.g., base Monad interface)
- Makes model laws explicit and verifiable (e.g., monad laws)
- Enables concrete concepts in design stage to derive from these contracts (e.g., Result Monad, IO Monad)
- Creates a clear contract inheritance hierarchy from abstract models to concrete implementations

**Specific Questions**:
- Should we introduce this as a formal intermediate layer in our 4-stage process?
- What would be the best structure for documenting these mathematical contracts?
- Should we implement a Haskell-based validator for verifying model laws?
- How do we ensure cross-language implementations respect these mathematical contracts?

**Prior Consideration**: We previously considered using Haskell to build this verification layer due to its strong type system and native support for these mathematical abstractions.

# Answer

## 1. Making Package Selection More Prominent

You're absolutely right - package selection is crucial but currently feels like a hidden step. The `sources/guides/package-research-methodology.md` document exists and correctly identifies itself as "The Missing Link," but it's not integrated into the main workflow in `sources/guides/guide.md`. Here's how to fix it:

### Update `sources/guides/guide.md` to explicitly include Stage 4 (Package Research):

```markdown
## The 5-Stage Process (Enhanced)

### **Stage 1: Natural Language → Mathematical Formalization**
- **Use**: `sources/guides/formal.prompt.md` + `sources/guides/common.md`
- **Input**: 
  - `sources/nl/qi.v4.class.contracts.md` 
  - `sources/nl/qi.v4.component.contracts.md`
- **Output**: `build/objective/formal/qi.v4.formal.spec.md`

### **Stage 2: Mathematical → Design Patterns**  
- **Use**: `sources/guides/design.prompt.md` + `sources/guides/common.md`
- **Input**: `build/objective/formal/qi.v4.formal.spec.md`
- **Output**: `build/design/qi.v4.design.analysis.md`

### **Stage 3: Design → Language-Agnostic Implementation**
- **Use**: `sources/guides/impl.prompt.md` + `sources/guides/common.md`
- **Input**: `build/design/qi.v4.design.analysis.md`
- **Output**: `build/impl/qi.v4.impl.template.md`

### **Stage 4: Package Research → Wrapper Design (INTEGRATE EXISTING)**
- **Use**: `sources/guides/package-research-methodology.md` + `sources/guides/common.md`
- **Input**: `build/impl/qi.v4.impl.template.md` + Target Language
- **Process**: Comprehensive package research → Evidence-based selection → Wrapper specification
- **Output**: `build/research/qi.v4.[LANG].packages.md` + `build/research/qi.v4.[LANG].wrappers.md`
- **Purpose**: Bridge mathematical contracts to production-ready packages

### **Stage 5: Templates + Research → Language-Specific Code**
- **Use**: `sources/guides/impl.[LANG].prompt.md` + package research outputs
- **Input**: 
  - `build/impl/qi.v4.impl.template.md`
  - `build/research/qi.v4.[LANG].packages.md`
  - `build/research/qi.v4.[LANG].wrappers.md`
- **Output**: `build/impl/qi.v4.[LANG].impl.md`
```

### Modify the workflow section in `sources/guides/guide.md`:

```markdown
## Previously: The Missing Integration

The `package-research-methodology.md` exists but was not integrated into the main workflow, creating a gap between theoretical contracts and practical implementation.

## Now: Integrated Package Research as Stage 4

**Stage 4 (Package Research)** now explicitly bridges:
- **Input**: Language-agnostic implementation templates
- **Process**: Evidence-based package selection using existing methodology
- **Output**: Language-specific package selections and wrapper specifications
- **Integration**: Feeds directly into language-specific implementation prompts

This makes package selection a **visible, mandatory step** rather than an implicit assumption.
```

## 2. Explicit Mathematical Model Contract Layer

Your insight about needing an explicit mathematical model contract layer is excellent. Rather than creating a new document, we should extract and formalize what's already implicit in `sources/guides/common.md`.

### Extract Mathematical Contracts from `sources/guides/common.md`

```markdown
# Mathematical Model Contracts (Extracted from common.md)

## Current State in sources/guides/common.md

The mathematical foundations are already defined but mixed with other content:
- **Categorical Structures**: Monads, Functors, Monoids (lines 29-40)
- **Required Patterns**: Circuit breaker, streaming, etc. (lines 156-218)
- **Component Architecture**: Base, Core, Application layers (lines 74-111)

## Proposed: Extract into Explicit Contract Interface Layer

Create `build/guides/mathematical-contracts.md` containing ONLY:

### Abstract Mathematical Models
```haskell
-- Base contracts that formal.spec.md implementations must satisfy
class Monad m where
  return :: a -> m a
  (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
  -- Laws: left identity, right identity, associativity

class Monoid a where
  mempty :: a
  mappend :: a -> a -> a  
  -- Laws: left identity, right identity, associativity
```

### Contract Hierarchy
```
`sources/nl/*.md` (Natural Language)
    ↓ (sources/guides/formal.prompt.md + sources/guides/common.md)
`build/objective/formal.spec.md` (Mathematical Definitions)
    ↓ (sources/guides/design.prompt.md + sources/guides/common.md + build/guides/mathematical-contracts.md + build/objective/formal.spec.md)
`build/design/*.md` (Concrete Design Patterns)
```

### Contract Usage Flow
```
1. sources/guides/formal.prompt.md + sources/guides/common.md + sources/nl/*.md → build/objective/formal.spec.md
2. sources/guides/design.prompt.md + sources/guides/common.md + build/guides/mathematical-contracts.md + build/objective/formal.spec.md → build/design/*.md
3. Result: Design stage uses both abstract contracts (from mathematical-contracts.md) AND concrete models (from formal.spec.md)
4. mathematical-contracts.md is a sources/ file (not build/) that provides the abstract interface layer
```

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Leverages Existing Structure**
- No duplication of `sources/guides/common.md` content
- Extracts and formalizes what's already implicit
- Maintains existing mathematical foundations

### 2. **Creates Clear Interface Layer**
- Abstract contracts separate from concrete implementations
- Design stage can derive from contracts (IO Monad from base Monad)
- Verification points explicit for cross-language consistency

### 3. **Practical Integration**
- `mathematical-contracts.md` becomes input to `design.prompt.md`
- Contracts guide design patterns rather than just documenting them
- Clear inheritance hierarchy: Abstract → Concrete → Implementation

## Proposed Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Extract Mathematical Contracts
Create `build/guides/mathematical-contracts.md` with:
- Abstract mathematical models (Monad, Functor, Monoid laws)
- Contract interfaces for design stage derivation
- Verification requirements for implementations

### Step 2: Update Stage 2 Process
Modify `sources/guides/design.prompt.md` to use:
- `build/objective/formal.spec.md` (concrete mathematical models)
- `build/guides/mathematical-contracts.md` (abstract interface contracts)
- Result: Design patterns that explicitly derive from abstract contracts

### Step 3: Cross-Language Verification
Update language-specific prompts to include:
- Contract compliance verification
- Mathematical law testing
- Performance within contract constraints

This approach makes the implicit mathematical contract layer **explicit and reusable** without duplicating existing work.
