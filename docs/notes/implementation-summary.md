# QiCore v4.0 Implementation Summary

> **Addressing the Two Key Issues**  
> **Date**: June 23, 2025  
> **Changes**: Package selection integration + Mathematical contract layer extraction + Workflow corrections

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Package Selection Visibility Problem ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue**: Package selection is the most critical step in implementation but was not clearly visible in the main workflow.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Updated `sources/guides/guide.md`**: Integrated existing `package-research-methodology.md` as explicit Stage 4
- **5-Stage Process**: Made package research a visible, mandatory step between language-agnostic templates and language-specific code
- **Clear Integration**: Package research now feeds directly into language-specific implementation prompts
- **Corrected Workflow Paths**: Fixed all agent workflow references to use correct `docs/agent/` paths

**Changes Made**:
1. **File**: `qicore-v4/docs/sources/guides/guide.md`
   - Updated to 5-stage process (was 4-stage)
   - Added Stage 4: Package Research → Wrapper Design (INTEGRATE EXISTING)
   - Corrected all file paths to use `sources/guides/` prefix
   - Updated manual process instructions with complete input specifications
   - Modified workflow description to show package research integration
   - Fixed agent workflow paths from `agent/build/` to `docs/agent/`

### 2. Mathematical Model Contract Layer ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue**: Mathematical models were explicitly defined in formal spec but formed an implicit reusable interface contract layer that wasn't extracted.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Created `sources/guides/mathematical-contracts.md`**: Extracted abstract mathematical contracts from existing `common.md`
- **Updated `sources/guides/design.prompt.md`**: Integrated mathematical contracts as input for design pattern derivation
- **Clear Contract Hierarchy**: Made explicit the flow from abstract contracts → concrete models → design patterns
- **Created Proper Stage 2 Workflow**: Added `docs/agent/inst.stage2.design.yaml` with complete input specifications

**Changes Made**:
1. **New File**: `qicore-v4/docs/sources/guides/mathematical-contracts.md`
   - Abstract mathematical models (Monad, Functor, Monoid, Effect, State Machine, Stream Coalgebra)
   - Contract usage flow showing integration with design stage
   - Performance constraints per language tier
   - Cross-language verification requirements
   - Clear integration instructions for design and implementation stages

2. **File**: `qicore-v4/docs/sources/guides/design.prompt.md`
   - Added `mathematical-contracts.md` as input document
   - Updated mathematical foundations section to use contract derivation strategy
   - Modified example to show explicit contract derivation pattern
   - Added contract compliance verification requirements

3. **New File**: `docs/agent/inst.stage2.design.yaml`
   - Proper Stage 2 workflow specification
   - Complete input specifications (design.prompt.md + common.md + mathematical-contracts.md + formal.spec.md)
   - Contract derivation process definition
   - Quality assurance and success criteria
   - Integration points for upstream/downstream stages

## Implementation Approach

### Leveraged Existing Structure ✅
- **No duplication**: Used existing `package-research-methodology.md` and `common.md` content
- **Integration not creation**: Modified existing workflow rather than creating new processes
- **Correct paths**: All references use actual qicore-v4 file structure

### Made Implicit Explicit ✅
- **Package selection**: Now visible as mandatory Stage 4 in main workflow
- **Mathematical contracts**: Extracted as reusable interface layer between formal spec and design
- **Clear hierarchy**: Abstract contracts → concrete models → design patterns → implementation

### Corrected Process Flow ✅
- **Complete input specifications**: All stages now show ALL required inputs (methodology + foundations + build artifacts)
- **Sources vs Build distinction**: Clear separation between methodology files (sources/) and build outputs (build/)
- **Workflow consistency**: Agent files and guide.md now reference same process and file paths

## Workflow Integration

### Enhanced 5-Stage Process
```
Stage 1: sources/nl + sources/guides/formal.prompt.md + sources/guides/common.md → build/objective/formal.spec.md

Stage 2: sources/guides/design.prompt.md + sources/guides/common.md + sources/guides/mathematical-contracts.md + build/objective/formal.spec.md → build/design/design.analysis.md

Stage 3: sources/guides/impl.prompt.md + sources/guides/common.md + build/design/design.analysis.md → build/impl/impl.template.md

Stage 4: sources/guides/package-research-methodology.md + sources/guides/common.md + build/impl/impl.template.md → build/research/[LANG].packages.md + [LANG].wrappers.md

Stage 5: sources/guides/impl.[LANG].prompt.md + build/impl/impl.template.md + build/research/[LANG].* → build/impl/[LANG].impl.md
```

### Mathematical Contract Bridge
```
common.md (existing foundations)
    ↓ (extract abstract contracts)
mathematical-contracts.md (new interface layer - sources file)
    ↓ (combine with concrete models)
design.prompt.md (enhanced derivation strategy)
    ↓ (produces patterns)
design patterns with explicit contract basis
```

### Corrected Workflow Automation
```
docs/agent/inst.formal.yaml - Stage 1 workflow
docs/agent/inst.stage2.design.yaml - Stage 2 workflow (NEW - uses mathematical-contracts.md)
docs/agent/inst.impl.yaml - Stage 3 workflow  
docs/agent/inst.research.[LANG].yaml - Stage 4 package research workflow
docs/agent/inst.impl.[LANG].yaml - Stage 5 implementation workflow
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Package Selection Now Visible
- Stage 4 makes package research mandatory and explicit
- Clear integration between templates and language-specific implementation
- Evidence-based package selection becomes part of standard workflow

### 2. Mathematical Foundation Clarified
- Abstract contracts serve as verification points for implementations
- Design patterns explicitly derive from mathematical contracts
- Cross-language consistency through shared abstract foundation

### 3. Process Consistency Fixed
- All file references use correct paths
- Sources vs build distinction properly maintained
- Agent workflows match guide.md process descriptions

### 4. Complete Input Specifications
- Every stage now specifies ALL required inputs
- Clear separation between methodology (sources/) and outputs (build/)
- mathematical-contracts.md properly positioned as sources file (not build output)
