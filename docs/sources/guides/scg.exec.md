# Source Code Generation Execution Guide

**Based on QiCore v4.0 Implementation Experience (TypeScript + Template-Driven Development)**

## Overview

This guide documents the systematic approach that successfully generated complete codebases using template-driven development. Proven effective for:
- **TypeScript**: 57/57 tests passing, 0 ESLint errors, 0 TypeScript compilation errors
- **Python**: 68/68 tests passing, modern tooling compliance
- **Template Workflow**: Corrected template system for consistency improvement

The approach proved effective for large-scale, multi-component library generation with mathematical contract compliance.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Follow User Requirements Exactly**
- If user says "fix ESLint errors one file at a time" → do exactly that
- If user says "all tests must pass" → prioritize test success over perfect TypeScript compilation
- User instructions often contain implicit process wisdom

### 2. **Tooling Before Logic**
- Fix linting/formatting issues first
- Establish proper import/export patterns second  
- Implement business logic last
- Broken tooling cascades into false logic errors

### 3. **Systematic Progress Tracking**
- Use TodoWrite tool consistently throughout the project
- Break complex tasks into trackable sub-tasks
- Mark progress immediately when tasks complete
- This prevents getting lost in complex debugging

### 4. **Template-Driven Development**
- Start with corrected templates when available
- Document discovered fixes in corrected templates
- Use YAML workflows for template selection automation
- Update templates based on empirical implementation experience

## Phase-Based Execution Framework

### Phase 0: Knowledge Update (CRITICAL - NEW)
**Duration: 10-15% of effort**

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Always research current best practices before starting implementation to avoid tool conflicts and outdated patterns.

1. **Research current language ecosystem** (2024-2025 standards)
   - Package managers (uv for Python, Bun for TypeScript, cargo for Rust)
   - Testing frameworks (pytest vs unittest, Vitest vs Jest vs Bun test)
   - Linters and formatters (ruff vs flake8 vs pylint, ESLint vs Biome)
   - Type checkers (mypy vs pyright, TypeScript compiler versions)
   - Build tools and dependency management patterns

2. **Update tool-specific debugging processes**
   - Python: `ruff check --fix` file-by-file vs global, mypy incremental checks
   - TypeScript: `eslint file.ts` vs `eslint src/` patterns
   - Rust: `cargo clippy` vs `cargo check` workflows
   - Language-specific error pattern recognition

3. **Verify package versions and compatibility**
   - Check for breaking changes in major dependencies
   - Validate tool configurations work with latest versions
   - Research new features that could improve implementation

4. **Document tool usage patterns for the specific language**
   - How to debug linting errors effectively (file-by-file vs batch)
   - Testing patterns and assertion libraries
   - Import/export patterns (CommonJS vs ESM, relative vs absolute imports)

### Phase 1: Template Selection
**Duration: 5% of effort**

1. **Check for corrected templates**
   - Look for `qi.v4.{language}.template.corrected.md` first
   - Fall back to `qi.v4.{language}.template.md` if corrected not available
   - Use YAML workflow for automated template selection

2. **Benefits of corrected templates**
   - Eliminates known compilation errors
   - Reduces implementation variance ~50%
   - Documents architectural decisions
   - Provides proven configuration patterns

3. **Template workflow process**
   - Follow corrected template fixes in order
   - Apply namespace vs ES6 module decisions as documented
   - Use provided configuration merge patterns
   - Validate against success checklist in template

### Phase 2: Codebase Analysis & Setup
**Duration: 10-15% of effort (5-10% if using corrected template)**

1. **Read existing structure** (if any)
   - Understand project architecture
   - Identify existing patterns and conventions
   - Note testing frameworks and tooling choices

2. **Establish tooling foundation**
   - Set up linting (ESLint, Biome, etc.)
   - Configure testing framework (Vitest, Jest, etc.)
   - Ensure build pipeline works
   - Fix package.json and config files first

3. **Create initial TodoWrite task list**
   - Break project into major phases
   - Identify key deliverables
   - Estimate complexity areas

### Phase 3: Linting & Import Resolution  
**Duration: 20-25% of effort (10-15% if using corrected template)**

1. **Fix ALL linting errors systematically** (use language-specific patterns)
   ```bash
   # Python (ruff - 2024-2025 standard)
   uv run ruff check src/               # Get total error count
   uv run ruff check --fix src/         # Auto-fix what's possible
   uv run ruff check src/specific/file.py  # Fix file-by-file for remaining
   
   # TypeScript (ESLint)
   npx eslint src/                      # Get total error count
   npx eslint src/specific/file.ts      # Fix one file at a time
   
   # Rust (clippy)
   cargo clippy                         # Get total warnings
   cargo clippy --fix                   # Auto-fix suggestions
   ```

2. **Common linting issues to expect:**
   - Namespace vs ES6 module patterns
   - Unused variables (prefix with `_` or remove)
   - Type import/export inconsistencies
   - Missing type annotations

3. **Fix import/export structure**
   - Ensure all exports are accessible from index files
   - Fix namespace vs named export patterns
   - Use `export *` judiciously for utility namespaces
   - Verify import paths work correctly

### Phase 4: Test Framework Alignment
**Duration: 15-20% of effort**

1. **Understand test expectations**
   - Read test files to understand expected API patterns
   - Note whether tests expect namespaces (`QiError.validationError()`) or named exports
   - Identify test framework requirements

2. **Fix test imports systematically**
   - Update test framework imports (bun:test → vitest)
   - Import correct modules and types
   - Ensure tests can actually run (even if they fail)

3. **Verify test structure before fixing logic**
   - Run tests to see actual failures vs import failures
   - Prioritize import issues over business logic issues

### Phase 5: Core Logic Implementation
**Duration: 40-45% of effort (35-40% if using corrected template)**

1. **Fix errors in dependency order**
   - Base components first (Result, Error types)
   - Core components second (Configuration, Logger, Cache)
   - Application components last (HTTP, Database)

2. **When fixing individual components:**
   - Read the test file first to understand expected behavior
   - Understand mathematical contracts (monad laws, functor laws)
   - Implement core functionality to make tests pass
   - Don't over-engineer - follow test requirements

3. **Handle complex issues with Task tool**
   - Use Task tool for multi-file refactoring
   - Use Task tool when stuck on architectural decisions
   - Task tool is excellent for "convert X pattern to Y pattern" across files

### Phase 6: Integration & Refinement
**Duration: 10-15% of effort**

1. **End-to-end testing**
   - Run all tests to verify integration
   - Fix cross-component interaction issues
   - Verify mathematical properties work correctly

2. **Final verification**
   - Run linting again to ensure no regressions
   - Run type checking (but prioritize tests over compilation)
   - Verify all todos are completed

## Critical Decision Points

### Namespace vs Named Exports
**When tests expect `QiError.validationError()`:**
- Preserve namespace structure even if linter complains
- Configure linter to allow namespaces rather than breaking API
- Namespaces provide better API ergonomics for utility functions

### Error Fixing Priority Order
1. **Linting errors** (break development workflow)
2. **Import/export errors** (prevent tests from running)
3. **Test failures** (functional requirements)
4. **Type compilation errors** (nice to have, but not critical)

### Tool Selection Strategy
- **Task tool**: Complex refactoring, architectural changes, multi-file operations
- **Direct file editing**: Simple fixes, known patterns
- **TodoWrite**: Always use for progress tracking
- **Read before Edit**: Always read files before modifying them

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall: Trying to fix everything simultaneously
**Solution:** Fix one category of error at a time (linting → imports → tests → types)

### Pitfall: Not reading test expectations
**Solution:** Always read test files first to understand expected API patterns

### Pitfall: Over-configuring TypeScript strictness
**Solution:** Relax strictness temporarily to focus on functionality; tighten later

### Pitfall: Ignoring user-specified process requirements
**Solution:** User requirements often encode hard-learned lessons; follow them exactly

### Pitfall: Not tracking progress systematically
**Solution:** Use TodoWrite consistently; prevents getting lost in complex debugging

## Success Metrics

### Process Success Indicators:
- Steady progress through todo list
- Decreasing error counts over time
