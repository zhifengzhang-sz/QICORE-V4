# STAGE 1 TRANSFORMATION OBJECTIVE
# ============================================================================

objective: |
  Transform natural language contracts into formal mathematical specifications by:
  
  1. **Contract Analysis**: Parse and understand natural language contracts
  2. **Mathematical Modeling**: Apply category theory to create formal models
  3. **Abstract Contract Satisfaction**: Ensure models satisfy mathematical-contracts.md
  4. **Complete Coverage**: Formalize ALL operations from both class and component contracts
  5. **Performance Specification**: Define realistic tier-based performance constraints
