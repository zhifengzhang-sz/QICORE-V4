# Comprehensive Verification Checklist

> **Complete verification criteria for QiCore v4.0 documentation**  
> Version: 1.0  
> Purpose: Ensure quality and completeness of agent-generated documentation

## 1. Objective Coverage Verification

### Contract Coverage
- [ ] All 8 class contracts from `objective/nl/qi.v4.class.contracts.md` are:
  - Mathematically formalized in `objective/formal/`
  - Analyzed in `design/`
  - Implemented in all language templates in `impl/`
  - Have working examples

### Component Coverage
- [ ] All 5 components from `objective/nl/qi.v4.component.contracts.md` are:
  - Defined as functors in formal spec
  - Have clear boundaries in design
  - Implemented as separate modules
  - Dependencies preserved (Base → Core → Application)

### Requirement Coverage
- [ ] Performance requirements specified → analyzed → implemented
- [ ] Error conditions defined → formalized → handled
- [ ] Side effects documented → tracked → managed
- [ ] Usage patterns described → examples provided

## 2. Cross-Reference Status

### Dependency Chain
- [ ] Every document includes "Depends on:" references
- [ ] References are valid (files exist)
- [ ] No broken links
- [ ] Dependency graph forms proper DAG

### Traceability Matrix
```
NL Spec → Formal Spec → Design → Implementation
- [ ] Each NL contract traceable to formal definition
- [ ] Each formal structure traceable to design pattern
- [ ] Each design pattern traceable to code implementation
- [ ] Each implementation traceable back to NL spec
```

## 3. Mathematical Consistency

- [ ] Functor laws (all components)
- [ ] Monoid laws (Configuration merging)
- [ ] Parser combinator laws (CLP)
