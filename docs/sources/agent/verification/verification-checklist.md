> **Complete verification criteria for QiCore v4.0 documentation**  
> **Version**: 2.0 (Updated June 25, 2025)  
> **Previous**: 1.0 (Original 8-component version)  
> **Purpose**: Ensure quality and completeness of 5-stage, 13-component architecture

## 1. Updated Architecture Coverage Verification

### Contract Coverage (13 Components)
- [ ] All 13 components from implementation template are:
  - Mathematically formalized in `build/objective/formal/`
  - Analyzed in `build/design/`
  - Researched in `build/package/[lang].md` for each language
  - Implemented in all language templates in `build/impl/`
  - Have working examples

### Component Coverage (Base → Core → Application)
- [ ] **Base Components (2/2)**: Result<T>, QiError
  - Defined with mathematical properties in formal spec
  - Have clear monad/product type boundaries in design
  - Implemented as foundational modules
  
- [ ] **Core Components (3/3)**: Configuration, Logger, Cache
  - Use correct mathematical patterns (monoid, effect, state)
  - Have clear operational boundaries in design
  - Dependencies on Base components only
  
- [ ] **Application Components (8/8)**: HTTP Client, Web Framework, ASGI Server, AI/LLM Client, MCP Protocol, Database, Document Generation, Command-Line Processing
  - All formalized with appropriate mathematical structures
  - Dependencies on Base + Core components preserved

### Requirement Coverage
- [ ] Performance requirements specified → analyzed → implemented
- [ ] Error conditions defined → formalized → handled

## 2. Cross-Reference Status

### Dependency Chain
- [ ] Every document includes "Depends on:" references

- [ ] Dependency graph forms proper DAG

### Updated Traceability Matrix (5-Stage)
```
NL Spec → Formal Spec → Design → Template → Package Research → Language Implementation
- [ ] Each NL contract traceable to formal definition
- [ ] Each formal structure traceable to design pattern  
- [ ] Each design pattern traceable to implementation template
- [ ] Each template component traceable to package research
- [ ] Each package selection traceable to language implementation
- [ ] Each implementation traceable back to NL spec
```
