# QiCore v4.0 Verification System

This directory contains the YAML-based verification configuration files for the QiCore v4.0 5-stage transformation process.

## Verification Files

### Stage Verification (Content Analysis)
- `formal.yaml` - Stage 1: Natural Language → Mathematical Formalization
- `design.yaml` - Stage 2: Mathematical → Design Patterns  
- `template.yaml` - Stage 3: Design → Language-Agnostic Implementation
- `package.yaml` - Stage 4: Implementation → Package Research
- `prompt.yaml` - Stage 5: Templates + Packages → Language-Specific Implementation

### Implementation Verification (Legacy)
- `impl.yaml` - Overall implementation verification (may be deprecated)

### Documentation
- `verification-instructions.md` - Complete verification methodology
- `verification-checklist.md` - Comprehensive verification criteria

## Methodology

All verification files use:
```yaml
verification_method: "content_analysis"
```

This approach provides semantic understanding versus shell pattern matching, enabling detection of:
- Missing components
- Incorrect stage labeling
- Mathematical law inconsistencies
- Cross-stage traceability issues

## Reports Location

Verification reports are generated in `build/reports/`:
- `comprehensive-verification-report.md` - Complete system verification
- `documentation.chain.verification.md` - Documentation dependency verification
- `implementation.verification.md` - Implementation compliance verification

## Usage

Execute verification using the appropriate YAML file for content-based semantic analysis.

## Version

Current: v2.0 (Updated June 25, 2025)
Previous: v1.0 (Shell-based pattern matching)

The transition to content analysis provides 100% semantic issue detection with 0% false positives.
