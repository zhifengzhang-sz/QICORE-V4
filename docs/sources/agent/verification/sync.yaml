# Cross-File Component Synchronization Verification
# Version: 1.0
# Purpose: Ensure component count and structure consistency across all QiCore files

process:
  name: "QiCore v4.0 Cross-File Component Synchronization"
  overview: |
    Detect component count inconsistencies across all stages and files.
    Uses existing verification tools as data sources to identify drift.
    Prevents the issue where verification reports become outdated.
