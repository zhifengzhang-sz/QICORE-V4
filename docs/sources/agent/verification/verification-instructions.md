# QiCore v4.0 Verification Instructions

> **Purpose**: Systematic verification of generated QiCore implementations  
> **Scope**: Formal specification compliance, implementation correctness, performance validation  
> Date: June 19, 2025

## Overview

This document provides instructions for verifying that generated QiCore implementations:
1. Comply with the formal mathematical specification
2. Implement all required contracts correctly
3. Meet performance requirements for their language tier
4. Achieve 95% compliance metrics

## Verification Workflow

```
1. Formal Specification Verification (formal.yaml)
   └─→ Verify mathematical properties are correctly formalized
   
2. Implementation Verification (impl.yaml)
   └─→ Verify code implements the formal specification
   
3. Performance Verification
   └─→ Verify performance meets language-tier requirements
   
4. Compliance Metrics
   └─→ Verify 95% property-based test coverage
```

## Verification Stages

### Stage 1: Formal Specification Verification

**Input**: `objective/formal/qi.v4.formal.spec.md`

**Verify**:
- [ ] All 8 class contracts have mathematical formalization
- [ ] Configuration uses monoid laws (not sheaf)
- [ ] Logging uses simple interface (not free monad)
- [ ] Performance specs are realistic by language tier
- [ ] Error recovery patterns included
- [ ] Circuit breaker patterns specified
- [ ] Streaming data handling addressed

### Stage 2: Design Analysis Verification

**Input**: `design/qi.v4.design.analysis.md`

**Verify**:
- [ ] Design patterns correctly derived from formal spec
- [ ] Monoid merge for configuration implemented
- [ ] Simple logging interface used
- [ ] Performance optimizations appropriate
- [ ] Component boundaries clearly defined

### Stage 3: Implementation Verification

**Input**: `impl/qi.v4.[lang].impl.md` and `impl/qi.v4.[lang].template.md`

**Verify**:
- [ ] All 8 contracts implemented
- [ ] Concrete, runnable examples provided
- [ ] Error handling demonstrated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks included
- [ ] 95% compliance metrics defined

## Performance Tiers

Verify implementations meet these performance targets:

| Language Type | Target Performance | Example Languages |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Native Compiled | < 1 microsecond | Rust, C++ |
| VM-based | < 10 microseconds | Go, Java |
| Interpreted | < 100 microseconds | Python, JavaScript |
| Functional | < 50 microseconds | Haskell |

## Compliance Metrics

**95% Compliance Definition**:
- 95% of property-based tests pass
- All core operations covered
- Mathematical laws verified
- Performance targets met

**Measurement Tools**:
- Property-based testing frameworks (QuickCheck, fast-check, hypothesis)
- Coverage reports
- Benchmark suites
- CI/CD integration

## Common Issues to Check

1. **Over-Engineering**:
   - Complex category theory where simple patterns suffice
   - Unrealistic performance targets
   - Missing practical examples

2. **Under-Specification**:
   - Missing error handling
   - No circuit breaker patterns
   - Incomplete streaming support

3. **Implementation Gaps**:
   - Interfaces without concrete implementations
   - Examples that don't compile/run
   - Missing performance measurements

## Verification Tools

- `formal.yaml`: Automated formal specification verification
- `impl.yaml`: Automated implementation verification
- Language-specific test suites
- Performance benchmark harnesses

## Next Steps

After verification:
1. Fix any identified issues
2. Re-run verification until 95% compliance achieved
3. Document any language-specific limitations
4. Update guides if patterns need adjustment
