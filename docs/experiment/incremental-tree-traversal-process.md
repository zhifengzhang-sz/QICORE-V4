# Incremental Tree-Traversal Implementation Process

> **A Systematic Process for Pattern-Matching Compatible Software Development**  
> **Version**: 1.0  
> **Purpose**: Actionable process definition for implementing complex software systems using LLM capabilities

## Process Overview

**Core Concept**: Implement complex software by starting at dependency tree leaves and adding one component at a time, using structured YAML instructions instead of natural language specifications.

**Key Principles**:
1. **Start at Tree Leaves**: Begin with components having minimal dependencies
2. **One Component Per Iteration**: Add single components with full validation
3. **YAML-Driven Instructions**: Use structured specifications instead of markdown
4. **Pattern Matching Compatible**: Design for LLM strengths, not weaknesses
5. **Incremental Validation**: Prove each step before proceeding

## Process Stages

```

## Decision Points

### Go/No-Go Criteria

**After Each Component**:
- All tests pass (unit, property, integration, performance)
- Mathematical properties verified
- Performance targets met
- Quality standards satisfied
- No regression in existing components

**Process Continuation**:
- **Continue**: If component successfully implemented and integrated
- **Pause**: If implementation fails but approach seems viable
- **Stop**: If fundamental approach issues identified

### Adaptation Rules

**Component Complexity Too High**:
- Break component into smaller sub-components
- Simplify mathematical requirements
- Reduce scope to manageable size

**YAML Instructions Insufficient**:
- Add more detailed specifications
- Include explicit implementation examples
- Refine instruction structure

**Integration Issues**:
- Revise component boundaries
- Adjust interface contracts
- Modify dependency relationships
