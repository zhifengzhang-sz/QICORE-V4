# QiCore Crypto Data Platform - Development Roadmap

**Step-by-step approach: Foundations → Fork & Learn → Build**

## 🎯 Current Status: ✅ Simple Case Working

The legacy MCP verification agent works perfectly:
- ✅ MCP servers connecting (memory + filesystem)
- ✅ Mathematical analysis generating sophisticated prompts
- ✅ File operations via MCP working
- ✅ Results saved to structured output

## 📋 Roadmap Overview

### Phase 1: Foundations (Infrastructure)
**Goal**: Set up the basic infrastructure components in separate containers

### Phase 2: Fork & Learn (Research)
**Goal**: Fork existing projects and understand how to build on them

### Phase 3: Simple Integration (Proof of Concept)
**Goal**: Connect one data source to one storage system

### Phase 4: App Development (Application Layer)
**Goal**: Build the agent application on top of proven foundations

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Foundations (2-3 weeks)

### 1.1 MCP Infrastructure Container
```
foundations/mcp-infrastructure/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── servers/
│   ├── memory/          # Memory MCP server
│   ├── filesystem/      # Filesystem MCP server  
│   ├── database/        # Future database MCP server
│   └── streaming/       # Future streaming MCP server
└── README.md
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create standalone MCP server container setup
- [ ] Test MCP connectivity in isolation

### 1.2 Database Foundation Container
```
foundations/database/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── timescaledb/
│   ├── init.sql
│   └── config/

## 🔍 Phase 2: Fork & Learn (1-2 weeks)

### 2.1 Research Projects to Fork

Based on our research in `docs/dp/existing-projects.md`:

**Primary Target: crypto-streaming**
```bash
# Fork the proven architecture

```

**Secondary Target: CCXT**
```bash
# Fork for exchange integration
git clone https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt ccxt-fork
cd ccxt-fork

# Focus areas:

- OHLCV data fetching
- WebSocket connections
```

**Reference: WolfBot**
```bash
# Fork for TypeScript patterns
git clone https://github.com/ekliptor/wolfbot wolfbot-fork
cd wolfbot-fork

# Extract components:

```

### 2.2 Learning Objectives

**For each forked project:**
- [ ] Understand the architecture patterns
- [ ] Identify reusable components
- [ ] Document integration opportunities
- [ ] Test basic functionality
- [ ] Plan adaptation strategy

## 🧪 Phase 3: Simple Integration (1 week)

### 3.1 Minimal Viable Data Pipeline

**Goal**: One data source → One storage system

```
CryptoCompare API → Node.js Collector → Redpanda → TimescaleDB
```

**Implementation:**
```
simple-integration/
├── collector/
│   └── cryptocompare-collector.js   # Simple REST API collection
├── consumer/  
│   └── timescale-writer.js          # Simple database writer
├── docker-compose.yml               # All containers
└── test-pipeline.js                 # End-to-end test
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Collect 1 symbol (BTCUSD) every 60 seconds
- [ ] Publish to Redpanda topic
- [ ] Consume and write to TimescaleDB
- [ ] Verify data integrity end-to-end
- [ ] Document the simple workflow

### 3.2 Success Criteria

- [ ] Data flows from API to database
- [ ] No data loss in the pipeline
- [ ] Basic error handling works
- [ ] Can query stored data
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (>100 records/sec)

---

## 🚀 Phase 4: App Development (2-3 weeks)

### 4.1 Agent Foundation on Proven Infrastructure

**Only after Phase 1-3 are working:**

```
app/
├── agents/
│   ├── simple-monitor.ts        # Start with one simple agent
│   └── base-agent.ts            # Minimal base class
├── mcp/
│   └── database-client.ts       # MCP client for databases
├── config/
│   └── simple-config.ts         # Basic configuration
└── index.ts                     # Simple entry point
```

### 4.2 Incremental Agent Development

**Week 1: One Agent**
- [ ] Simple market monitoring agent
- [ ] Connect to proven data pipeline
- [ ] Basic alert generation
- [ ] MCP integration working

**Week 2: Two Agents**  
- [ ] Add simple analysis agent
- [ ] Agent-to-agent communication
- [ ] Basic coordination patterns
- [ ] Error handling between agents

**Week 3: Full System**

### Benefits of Separation

1. **Foundations can be reused** by multiple applications
2. **Forked projects remain clean** with clear modification tracking  
3. **App development** focuses on business logic, not infrastructure
4. **Testing is isolated** - can test each layer independently
5. **Deployment is flexible** - foundations vs app can scale differently

## 🎯 Next Immediate Steps

### This Week
1. **Test simple case more thoroughly** - make sure legacy agent is solid
2. **Set up foundations project** - create the container infrastructure
3. **Fork the three key projects** - get local copies to study

### Next Week  
1. **Build minimal data pipeline** - one source to one destination
2. **Document learnings** from forked projects
3. **Plan integration strategy** - how to adapt existing code

### Following Week
1. **Start simple agent development** - one agent on proven infrastructure
2. **Test agent + infrastructure integration**
3. **Plan full system development**

## 💡 Key Principles

1. **Start simple** - one component at a time
2. **Prove each layer** before building the next
3. **Fork and learn** before building from scratch
4. **Keep concerns separated** - infrastructure vs application
5. **Test incrementally** - each phase must work before continuing

This approach gives us:
- ✅ **Lower risk** - each step is small and testable
- ✅ **Better understanding** - we learn existing patterns before creating new ones
- ✅ **Reusable foundations** - infrastructure can support multiple apps
- ✅ **Clear progress** - each phase has concrete deliverables
- ✅ **Maintainable codebase** - separation of concerns from the start

Sound good? Should we start with setting up the foundations project?
