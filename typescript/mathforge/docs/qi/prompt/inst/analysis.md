# QiPrompt Formal Mathematical Specification Instructions

> **Purpose**: Generate formal mathematical verification of QiPrompt algebraic property specifications  
> **Input**: Enhanced property specifications from `../nl/qiprompt.contracts.md`

## Important: Specification Preservation

**DO ENHANCE** the mathematical property specifications:
- `../nl/qiprompt.contracts.md` - Enhanced with complete algebraic properties for prompt execution

**Dependencies to Reference**:
- `../../core/nl/class.contracts.corrected.md` - QiCore base components (Result<T>, QiError)
- `../../core/nl/component.contracts.md` - QiCore component patterns

The enhanced specs build upon QiCore foundations to create sophisticated prompt execution patterns.  

## Instructions for AI

You are now ready to execute the formal analysis process. Follow these steps:

### Step 0: Backup Current Specifications
**Action**: Before any analysis, preserve the current enhanced specifications:
- Copy `nl/qiprompt.contracts.md` â†’ `nl/qiprompt.contracts.0.md`

This preserves the baseline enhanced specifications before iterative refinement.

### Step 1: Execute Property Discovery Analysis
**Action**: Use the methodology from `discovery.md` to analyze the property specifications in `nl/qiprompt.contracts.md`.

**Focus Questions**:
- What mathematical models naturally emerge from prompt compilation and execution properties?
- Are the properties sufficient to force unique prompt execution patterns?
- Which desired workflows (like `prompt.compile().execute().cache()`) are mathematically inevitable vs. just possible?
- What additional properties would make multi-provider execution patterns mathematically forced?

### Step 2: Generate Formal Mathematical Specification
**Create**: Complete mathematical formalization in this file (`spec.md`) with:

1. **Mathematical Model Selection Results**
   - For each contract: identified optimal mathematical structure (Monoid, Monad, etc.)
   - Justification: why this structure best satisfies the given properties
   - Inevitability assessment: what implementation patterns are forced vs. optional

2. **Property Gap Analysis**
   - Missing properties that would force more elegant workflows
   - Mathematical ambiguities where multiple valid interpretations exist
   - Implementation flexibility that could lead to poor ergonomics

3. **Workflow Validation Results**
   - Assessment of whether desired patterns like fluent chaining are mathematically inevitable
   - Identification of escape hatches where poor implementations remain valid
   - Recommendations for additional constraining properties

4. **Enhancement Recommendations**
   - Specific additional algebraic properties needed for mathematical inevitability
   - Justification for why each property eliminates ambiguity
   - Validation that enhanced properties force desired workflows

### Step 3: Document for Iteration Process
**Purpose**: This analysis will be used by the iterative agent (`formal.md`) to enhance the property specifications in `../nl/`.

**Input**: Discovery results from `../formal/discovery-results.md`

**Key Outputs Needed**:
- Clear identification of mathematical model gaps
- Specific property enhancement proposals  
- Validation tests for mathematical inevitability
- Assessment of convergence toward elegant workflow forcing

## Success Criteria for This Analysis

**Mathematical Rigor**: Every model selection must be justified by pattern matching against the provided algebraic properties.

**Gap Identification**: Clear identification of where current properties allow mathematical ambiguity or implementation flexibility that prevents elegant workflow inevitability.

**Enhancement Specificity**: Concrete proposals for additional properties that would close identified gaps.

**Workflow Focus**: Primary focus on making fluent patterns like `config.load().validate()` mathematically inevitable rather than accidental.

**Iteration Readiness**: Output must be actionable for the iterative enhancement process.

## Execute Analysis Now

**Your task**: 
1. First run `discovery.md` analysis on `nl/qiprompt.contracts.md` 
2. Write discovery results to `formal/discovery-results.md`
3. Then generate the formal mathematical analysis in `formal/analysis-results.md`

The goal is to identify what's missing from the current QiPrompt property specifications that would make elegant prompt execution workflows mathematically inevitable consequences of the algebraic laws.
