# QiCore v4.0 Mathematical Component Contracts

> **Purpose**: Complete algebraic specifications for component composition and dependency relationships  
> **Audience**: AI system architects, component designers, dependency injection systems  
> **Method**: Mathematical composition laws that enable AI to derive component architectures  

## Component Philosophy

Components are **mathematical modules** with explicit dependency algebras. AI systems pattern match on these compositional structures to derive:
- Dependency injection patterns (category theory → IoC containers)
- Initialization sequences (partial ordering → startup choreography) 
- Component boundaries (interface segregation → clean architectures)
- Error propagation (algebraic effects → fault isolation)

## Component Dependency Algebra

### Mathematical Structure
**Category with Dependency Functor**
- **Objects**: Components (Base, Core, Application)
- **Morphisms**: Dependencies between components
- **Composition**: Transitive dependency relationships
- **Identity**: Self-dependency (each component depends on itself)

### Dependency Laws
```
Transitivity: A → B ∧ B → C ⟹ A → C
Acyclic: No component can transitively depend on itself  
Minimal: Dependencies are irreducible (no redundant paths)
```

### Component Hierarchy Properties
```
Base: ∅ → Base (no dependencies)
Core: Base → Core (depends only on Base)
Application: {Base, Core} → Application (depends on both)
```

## Mathematical Derivation Examples

These complete algebraic properties enable AI to derive:

**From Dependency Laws** → **IoC Container Architecture**:
```

```

**From Monoid Laws** → **Service Composition**:

config.merge(file).merge(env).merge(cli)
// Configuration composition follows associative laws
```

**From Effect Laws** → **Error Boundary Design**:
```
component.operation().recoverWith(fallback)
// Effect isolation enables fault tolerance
```

**From Circuit Breaker Laws** → **Resilience Patterns**:
```

// State machine laws ensure proper failure handling
```

The mathematical properties provide **complete guidance** for AI to derive robust, composable component architectures without explicit architectural documentation.
