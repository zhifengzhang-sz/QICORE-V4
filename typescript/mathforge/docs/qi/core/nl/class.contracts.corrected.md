# QiCore v4.0 Mathematical Class Contracts (Corrected Stage 1)

> **Purpose**: Complete algebraic specifications that enable AI pattern matching to derive optimal mathematical models and ergonomic APIs  
> **Audience**: AI code generators, compiler designers, mathematical verification  
> **Method**: Pure mathematical properties that constrain implementation space without pre-determining models  

## Contract Philosophy

These contracts specify **complete algebraic properties** for each type without pre-assigning mathematical structures. AI systems analyze these mathematical constraints to discover:
- The optimal mathematical model that satisfies all properties
- Compositional APIs that emerge from the discovered structure
- Error handling patterns that become mathematically inevitable
- Performance characteristics that are structurally guaranteed

**Key Principle**: Properties define constraints; AI discovers the mathematical structures that satisfy them.

## QiError Contract

### Required Mathematical Properties

**Context Operations**:
```
Identity Element: There exists an empty context ∅ such that e ⊕ ∅ = e
Associativity: (e ⊕ c₁) ⊕ c₂ = e ⊕ (c₁ ∪ c₂) for all contexts c₁, c₂
Immutability: e ⊕ c ≠ e (operation returns new instance)
Closure: Context operations preserve error structure and validity
```

**Cause Chain Operations**:
```
Acyclic Property: e₁ ∘ e₂ ∘ ... ∘ eₙ where eᵢ ≠ eⱼ for i ≠ j
Bounded Depth: depth(cause_chain) ≤ 10 for all valid chains
Category Preservation: category(e₁ ∘ e₂) = category(e₁)
Transitivity: If A caused B and B caused C, then A transitively caused C
```

**Composition Requirements**:
```
Chaining Support: Operations must support method chaining syntax
Context Accumulation: Multiple context operations accumulate without loss
Builder Pattern: Construction operations must compose fluently
Type Preservation: Chained operations maintain QiError type throughout
```

### Required Workflow Patterns

**Error Enrichment Workflow**:
- Context addition must be chainable and accumulative
- Cause assignment must integrate with context chaining
- Builder-like construction must be natural and intuitive
- All operations must preserve debugging information

---

## Result<T> Contract

### Required Mathematical Properties

**Function Mapping Laws**:
```
Identity Preservation: map(identity_function) = identity_result
Composition Preservation: map(f ∘ g) = map(f) ∘ map(g)
Type Safety: map preserves success/failure state structure
```

**Operation Chaining Laws**:
```
Left Identity: unit(a) >>= f = f(a) for any value a and function f
Right Identity: m >>= unit = m for any result m
Associativity: (m >>= f) >>= g = m >>= (λx. f(x) >>= g)
```

**Error Propagation Laws**:
```
Failure Preservation: failure(e) >>= f = failure(e) for any function f
Success Transformation: success(a) >>= f = f(a) for any function f
Context Preservation: Error context never lost through operation chains
Short-Circuit: First failure stops chain execution immediately
```

### Required Workflow Patterns

**Railway-Oriented Programming**:
- Success path continues through transformations
- Error path bypasses transformations and propagates
- Clean separation between happy path and error handling
- Composable error handling strategies

---

## Configuration Contract

### Required Mathematical Properties

**Merge Operation Laws**:
```
Associativity: (a ⊕ b) ⊕ c = a ⊕ (b ⊕ c) for all configurations a, b, c
Identity Element: There exists empty configuration ∅ such that ∅ ⊕ a = a ⊕ ∅ = a
Closure: Merge operation produces valid configuration
```

**Pipeline Composition Properties**:
```
Sequential Composition: load ∘ validate ∘ merge operations must compose
Error Propagation: Pipeline failures propagate without execution continuation
Method Chaining: Operations must return types supporting fluent chaining
Composition Associativity: (load.validate).merge = load.(validate.merge)
```

### Required Workflow Patterns

**Configuration Loading Pipeline**:
- Multiple source loading must compose naturally
- Validation must integrate seamlessly with loading
- Error handling must be consistent across all operations
- Fluent chaining must be natural and intuitive

---

## Logger Contract

### Required Mathematical Properties

**Level Ordering Properties**:
```
Total Ordering: ERROR > WARN > INFO > DEBUG > TRACE
Monotonic Filtering: if level ≥ threshold then log(level, msg) executes
Filtering Consistency: isEnabled(level) ↔ level ≥ currentLevel
```

**Context Operations Properties**:
```
Context Accumulation: Multiple context operations accumulate without loss
Context Preservation: Log operations inherit accumulated context automatically
Context Immutability: Each context operation returns new Logger instance
Context Associativity: withContext(c₁).withContext(c₂) = withContext(c₁ ∪ c₂)
```

### Required Workflow Patterns

**Structured Logging with Context**:
- Context must thread through operations automatically
- Log level filtering must be efficient (< 1μs)
- Context enrichment must be chainable and composable
- Output formatting must be configurable and extensible

---

## Cache Contract

### Required Mathematical Properties

**Storage Invariants**:
```
Deterministic Access: get(key) after set(key, value) returns value (within TTL)
TTL Monotonicity: Values expire after TTL seconds, never before
Eviction Consistency: LRU eviction when capacity exceeded
```

**Operation Composition Properties**:
```
Operation Chaining: get(k).orElse(fetch).set(k,v) must compose naturally
Error Propagation: Failed operations propagate through composition chains
Async Composition: Async operations compose according to async operation laws
TTL Preservation: Chained operations preserve TTL semantics throughout
```

### Required Workflow Patterns

**Cache-Aside Pattern**:
- Get-or-fetch operations must compose naturally
- Cache invalidation must integrate with updates
- TTL management must be automatic and reliable
- Error handling must be consistent across all operations

---

## Universal Constraints

**Cross-Contract Requirements**:
```
Error Handling: All operations that can fail must return Result<T>
Context Preservation: Error context must never be lost
Composition Support: Operations must support natural chaining
Immutability: Operations must not mutate existing instances
Type Safety: Strong typing must be preserved through all operations
```

**Workflow Inevitability Constraints**:
```
Chain Preservation: Intermediate unwrapping of container types is prohibited
Fluent Requirement: Operations returning chainable types must support method syntax
Terminal Operations: Only designated operations can terminate fluent chains
Context Threading: Context must thread automatically without manual management
```

## AI Discovery Process

**Stage 2 Analysis Should Discover**:
1. **Mathematical Models**: Which algebraic structures satisfy these properties
2. **Composition Patterns**: How the discovered structures naturally compose
3. **API Inevitability**: Why certain API patterns become mathematically forced
4. **Implementation Guidance**: What patterns emerge from the mathematical structures

The mathematical structures should **emerge from the properties**, not be pre-determined.
