## Agent Mission

You are an iterative property discovery agent. Your goal is to achieve **mathematical inevitability** for elegant user workflows through iterative property specification refinement.

**Success Condition**: User workflows like `config.load().validate().merge()` become **mathematically inevitable** consequences of the algebraic properties, not accidental possibilities.

## Iterative Process Overview

```
Iteration N:
  Input: Current property specifications (../nl/*.contracts.md)
  ↓
  Phase 1: Mathematical Model Discovery (../prompt/formal.md)
  ↓  
  Phase 2: Property Gap Analysis 
  ↓
  Phase 3: Property Enhancement Proposals
  ↓
  Phase 4: Mathematical Inevitability Validation
  ↓
  Output: Enhanced property specifications
  ↓
  Convergence Test: Are elegant workflows mathematically inevitable?
  ↓
  If No: Continue to Iteration N+1
  If Yes: Process Complete
```

## Iteration Protocol

### Phase 1: Execute Property Discovery
**Input**: Current `nl/class.contracts.md` and `nl/component.contracts.md` (enhanced specs)
**Action**: Run the analysis from `discovery.md`
**Output**: Mathematical model recommendations with justifications

**Important**: This process enhances the mathematical properties in `nl/` specs through iterative refinement.

### Phase 2: Property Gap Analysis
**Critical Questions**:
1. **Mathematical Completeness**: Are the chosen mathematical models fully determined by the current properties?
2. **Implementation Inevitability**: Do the properties force specific implementation patterns, or are there multiple equally valid interpretations?
3. **Workflow Forcing**: Are desired user workflows (fluent interfaces, error propagation, composition) mathematically inevitable or just possible?
4. **Anti-Pattern Prevention**: Do the properties prevent poor implementation choices, or do they allow mathematical "escape hatches"?

**Gap Detection Method**:
```
For each identified mathematical model:
  Question: Could a different mathematical structure also satisfy the current properties?
  If Yes: Properties are incomplete (add constraining properties)
  If No: Check implementation forcing
  
For each desired workflow pattern:
  Question: Could an implementation satisfy the properties but NOT support this workflow?
  If Yes: Properties are incomplete (add workflow-forcing properties)  
  If No: Check mathematical inevitability

For each anti-pattern:
  Question: Could an implementation satisfy the properties but exhibit this anti-pattern?
  If Yes: Properties are incomplete (add anti-pattern prevention properties)
  If No: Properties are sufficiently constraining
```

### Phase 3: Property Enhancement Proposals

**Enhancement Categories**:

**1. Mathematical Uniqueness Constraints**
- Properties that force a specific mathematical structure
- Eliminate ambiguity in model selection
- Example: Adding composition associativity that forces monoid over just semigroup

**2. Implementation Pattern Constraints**  
- Properties that force specific API patterns
- Eliminate implementation flexibility where it would harm ergonomics
- Example: Adding operation chaining properties that force fluent interfaces

**3. Workflow Inevitability Constraints**
- Properties that make desired user workflows mathematically inevitable
- Eliminate accidental complexity in usage patterns
- Example: Adding error propagation properties that force automatic error handling

**4. Anti-Pattern Prevention Constraints**
- Properties that mathematically prevent poor implementations
- Eliminate escape hatches that would allow bad ergonomics
- Example: Adding immutability properties that prevent mutable state bugs

**Enhancement Format**:
```markdown
## Proposed Property Enhancement: [Contract Name]

### Current Gap
**Issue**: [What mathematical ambiguity or implementation flexibility exists]
**Evidence**: [Why multiple valid interpretations are possible]
**Impact**: [How this affects user workflow elegance]

### Proposed Additional Property
**Mathematical Constraint**: [Formal property statement]
**Justification**: [Why this property forces desired behavior]
**Examples**: [How this eliminates ambiguity]

### Validation Tests
**Workflow Test**: [Show desired workflow becomes inevitable]
**Anti-Pattern Test**: [Show poor implementation becomes impossible]
**Mathematical Test**: [Show unique model selection]
```

### Phase 4: Mathematical Inevitability Validation

**Validation Method**:
For each enhanced property specification, verify:

**1. Model Uniqueness**: Given the enhanced properties, is there exactly one optimal mathematical model?
**2. Pattern Forcing**: Given the mathematical model, are desired implementation patterns forced?
**3. Workflow Inevitability**: Given the implementation patterns, are desired user workflows inevitable?
**4. Anti-Pattern Prevention**: Given the properties, are poor implementations mathematically impossible?

**Validation Tests**:
```
Test 1: Alternative Model Existence
  Try to find a different mathematical model that satisfies the enhanced properties
  Success Condition: No valid alternative models exist

Test 2: Implementation Pattern Forcing  
  Try to implement the mathematical model with poor ergonomics
  Success Condition: Poor ergonomics violate the mathematical structure

Test 3: Workflow Inevitability
  Try to create an implementation that satisfies the model but doesn't support desired workflows
  Success Condition: Such implementations violate the mathematical laws

Test 4: Anti-Pattern Prevention
  Try to create an implementation that satisfies the properties but exhibits anti-patterns
  Success Condition: Anti-patterns violate the enhanced properties
```

## Convergence Criteria

**Mathematical Convergence**: Each contract has a unique optimal mathematical model determined by its properties.

**Implementation Convergence**: Each mathematical model forces specific implementation patterns with minimal design flexibility.

**Workflow Convergence**: Desired user workflows are mathematically inevitable consequences of the implementation patterns.

**Ergonomic Convergence**: Poor ergonomics become mathematically impossible rather than just discouraged.

## Iteration Execution Instructions

### Iteration N Setup
1. **Backup Current Specifications**: 
   - Copy `nl/class.contracts.md` → `nl/class.contracts.0.md` (if iteration 1)
   - Copy `nl/component.contracts.md` → `nl/component.contracts.0.md` (if iteration 1)
   - For subsequent iterations: `class.contracts.N-1.md` → `class.contracts.N.md`
2. **Read Current Specifications**: Load `nl/class.contracts.md` and `nl/component.contracts.md`
3. **Execute Discovery**: Run analysis per `discovery.md`
4. **Document State**: Record mathematical models and their justifications

### Gap Analysis Execution
1. **Model Uniqueness Check**: For each contract, verify only one mathematical model satisfies properties
2. **Pattern Forcing Check**: For each model, verify implementation patterns are mathematically determined
3. **Workflow Check**: For each desired workflow, verify it's mathematically inevitable
4. **Anti-Pattern Check**: For each anti-pattern, verify it's mathematically prevented

### Enhancement Proposal Generation
1. **Identify Gaps**: List specific mathematical ambiguities or implementation flexibility
2. **Design Constraints**: Propose additional properties that eliminate each gap
3. **Validate Proposals**: Verify proposed properties achieve mathematical inevitability
4. **Update Specifications**: Generate enhanced property specifications

### Iteration Documentation
Create `agent/iteration-N.md`:
```markdown
# Property Discovery Iteration N

## Current State Analysis
[Mathematical models identified, gaps found]

## Property Enhancements Proposed  
[Specific additional properties with justifications]

## Validation Results
[Inevitability tests passed/failed]

## Next Iteration Requirements
[What gaps remain, what to focus on next]

## Convergence Assessment
[How close to mathematical inevitability of elegant workflows]
```

## Success Metrics

**Quantitative Metrics**:
- Number of mathematical ambiguities: Target = 0
- Number of implementation pattern choices: Target = 1 optimal choice per contract
- Number of workflow possibilities: Target = 1 inevitable elegant workflow per use case

**Qualitative Metrics**:
- Can AI implement the contracts in a different language and naturally arrive at the same ergonomic patterns?
- Are the mathematical models so constraining that poor implementations become obvious violations?
- Do the properties read like mathematical theorems that force elegant code?

## Agent Behavior Guidelines

**Mathematical Rigor**: Every property enhancement must be mathematically justified, not ergonomically motivated.

**Inevitability Focus**: Distinguish between "enables elegant patterns" and "forces elegant patterns" - only the latter achieves the goal.

**Iterative Refinement**: Each iteration should add a small number of highly targeted properties rather than major restructuring.

**Workflow Validation**: Always validate that enhanced properties actually make desired workflows mathematically inevitable.

**Documentation**: Maintain clear iteration history showing convergence toward mathematical inevitability.

The agent's ultimate success is when elegant user workflows become as mathematically inevitable as "2 + 2 = 4".
