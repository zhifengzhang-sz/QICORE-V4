# QiAgent Natural Language Contracts

> **Stage 1: Enhanced Property Specifications**  
> **Depends on**: QiCore, QiPrompt, QiMCP Components  
> **Purpose**: Mathematical properties for workflow orchestration and semi-agent behavior  
> **Audience**: AI mathematical verification and pattern discovery  

## Contract Philosophy

QiAgent serves as the sophisticated workflow orchestrator with complete mathematical properties that constrain the implementation space. AI systems analyze these algebraic constraints to discover optimal mathematical structures for coordinating prompt execution, tool integration, and process management.

**Key Principle**: Properties define orchestration necessities; AI discovers the coordination structures that satisfy them.

## Workflow Orchestration Contract

### Required Mathematical Properties

**Node Execution Laws**:
```
Sequential Determinism: Node execution follows deterministic order within workflows
State Preservation: Node state is preserved across execution boundaries
Dependency Resolution: Node dependencies are resolved before execution
Context Threading: Execution context flows automatically between nodes
```

**Workflow Composition Laws**:
```
Associativity: Workflow composition is associative: (A ∘ B) ∘ C = A ∘ (B ∘ C)
Identity: Empty workflow serves as identity element for composition
Closure: Workflow composition preserves execution validity
Determinism: Same workflow inputs produce equivalent outputs
```

**Error Propagation Laws**:
```
Short-Circuit Behavior: First failure stops workflow execution immediately
Context Preservation: Error context accumulates through workflow execution
Recovery Capability: Workflows can be resumed from failure points
Rollback Consistency: Failed workflows can be rolled back to consistent state
```
