# Approach 0: Simple Agent Testing (Baseline)

## Overview
Approach 0 serves as a **baseline control** for the MathForge consistency experiment. It tests the raw capabilities of our Ollama-only agent without any structured guidance, formal specifications, or consistency mechanisms.

## Purpose
- Establish baseline performance metrics
- Test agent functionality and reliability
- Validate the experimental setup
- Provide a control group for comparison with Approaches 1-3

## Methodology

### Input
- **Minimal prompts**: Simple, direct requests without structured guidance
- **No design patterns**: No MAX-MIN principle or architectural guidance
- **No formal specifications**: No mathematical or formal verification constraints
- **Raw AI interaction**: Direct prompt → AI → response

### Process
1. Initialize Ollama-only agent
2. Send simple, unstructured prompts
3. Measure response quality and consistency
4. Record performance metrics
5. Analyze output for baseline characteristics

### Example Prompts
```
"Create a Result type in TypeScript"
"Make a logger function"
"Build a cache system"
"Write error handling code"
"Create a configuration manager"
```

## Expected Outcomes
- **Inconsistent patterns**: Each generation likely to use different approaches
- **Variable quality**: Quality depends on prompt phrasing and model state
- **No architectural cohesion**: Components won't follow unified design principles
- **Functional but not systematic**: Code works but lacks systematic design

## Success Metrics
- **Functional correctness**: Does the generated code compile and run?
- **Response time**: How fast does the agent respond?
- **Code length**: How verbose are the generated solutions?
- **Pattern consistency**: How similar are multiple generations of the same request?

## Key Insights Expected
- Raw AI capabilities without guidance
- Natural variation in AI responses
- Baseline consistency levels
- Performance characteristics under minimal constraints

## Comparison Value
This approach provides the **control group** to measure the effectiveness of:
- Approach 1: Structured specifications
- Approach 2: Design patterns + MAX-MIN principle  
- Approach 3: Formal verification constraints
