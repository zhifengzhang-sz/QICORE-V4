# MathForge Empirical Study: Ready for Execution

> **Status**: ✅ **READY TO EXECUTE**  
> **Documentation**: Complete with actual QiCore v4 specifications  
> **Methodology**: Detailed and measurable  
> **Goal**: Compare AI code generation approaches using real-world documentation  

## 🎯 Experiment Overview

### Research Question
**"How do different levels of guidance affect AI consistency and quality when implementing complex software components?"**

Using actual QiCore v4 documentation as input, we compare three approaches:
1. **Approach 1**: Basic AI generation with minimal guidance
2. **Approach 2**: Structured guidance with design patterns and process
3. **Approach 3**: Verification-enhanced with formal property testing

## 📋 Implementation Target: QiCore v4 Components

### Base Component
- **Result<T>**: Type-safe error handling with functional composition
- **QiError**: Structured error representation with context and chaining

### Core Component  
- **Configuration**: Multi-source config loading with monoid merge semantics
- **Logger**: Simple effect interface with level-based filtering
- **Cache**: High-performance caching with eviction policies

**Total Scope**: 5 components with complex mathematical properties and integration requirements
