# Approach 2: Structured Guidance

> **Method**: Natural Language Specification + Design + MAX-MIN Principle → AI → Source Code  
> **Role**: Treatment group with structured guidance  
> **Goal**: Measure impact of design patterns and package recommendations  

## Approach Overview

This approach provides comprehensive guidance to AI including natural language specifications, design patterns, architecture constraints, and the MAX-MIN principle (maximize package usage, minimize custom implementation). This tests whether structured guidance improves consistency and quality.

## Documentation Structure

### Comprehensive Guidance Package

The documentation for this approach includes:
- **Functional requirements** (same as Approach 1)
- **Design patterns** and architectural constraints
- **Package recommendations** with rationale
- **MAX-MIN principle** application guidance
- **Quality criteria** and best practices
- **Integration patterns** between components
- **Error handling strategies**

### Components to Implement

Based on QiCore v4 documentation with comprehensive guidance:

**Base Component**:
1. **Result<T>** - Type-safe error handling with functional composition
2. **QiError** - Structured error representation with context and chaining

**Core Component**:
3. **Configuration** - Multi-source config loading with monoid merge semantics
4. **Logger** - Simple effect interface with level-based filtering
5. **Cache** - High-performance caching with eviction policies

### Supporting Documentation

- `qi.v4.class.contracts.md` - Detailed class-level contracts and specifications
- `qi.v4.component.contracts.md` - Component architecture and interfaces  
- `patterns.md` - Design patterns and architectural guidance (Either monad, Monoid patterns)
- `impl.md` - Implementation guidance and best practices
- `process.v2.yaml` - Complete development process with MAX-MIN principle

## Key Guidance Elements

### MAX-MIN Principle Application

**MAXIMIZE Usage Of**:
- Battle-tested packages for complex functionality
- Established patterns and conventions
- Community-standard approaches
- Existing type definitions and interfaces

**MINIMIZE Custom Implementation Of**:
- Complex algorithms and data structures
- Error handling edge cases
- Cross-cutting concerns (logging, caching, etc.)
- Infrastructure and utility functions

### Design Pattern Constraints

**Functional Programming Patterns**:
- Immutable data structures
- Pure functions where possible
- Railway-oriented programming for error handling
- Composition over inheritance

**Error Handling Strategy**:
- Result<T> monad for all fallible operations
- Structured error types with categories
- Graceful degradation patterns
- Comprehensive error context

**Architecture Patterns**:
- Dependency injection for testability
- Interface segregation
- Single responsibility principle
- Clear separation of concerns

### Package Selection Criteria

**Evaluation Framework**:
- **Maturity**: Active development, stable API
- **Community**: Wide adoption, good documentation
- **Quality**: High test coverage, low bug reports
- **Integration**: TypeScript support, modern tooling
- **Maintenance**: Regular updates, security patches

## Experimental Protocol

### Generation Process
1. Provide complete guidance package
2. Emphasize MAX-MIN principle adherence
3. Request AI to explain package choices
4. Accept implementation that follows guidance
5. Record deviations from recommendations
6. Repeat 5 times for each component

### Required AI Deliverables
- **Implementation** following design patterns
- **Package justification** for each dependency
- **MAX-MIN analysis** showing custom vs. package code ratio
- **Integration plan** with other components
- **Quality checklist** verification

### Data Collection
- **Guidance adherence** rate and deviations
- **Package selection** patterns and rationale
- **MAX-MIN compliance** measurements
- **Design pattern** implementation consistency
- **Quality metrics** against specified criteria
- **AI reasoning** about trade-offs and decisions

## Expected Outcomes

### Predicted Improvements Over Approach 1
- **Higher consistency** across generations
- **Better package utilization** following MAX-MIN
- **Improved code quality** through pattern guidance
- **More robust error handling** with structured approaches
- **Better integration** between components

### Specific Metrics to Track
- **Design Pattern Compliance**: % following specified patterns
- **MAX-MIN Ratio**: Package code vs. custom code percentage
- **Package Quality Score**: Based on selection criteria
- **Consistency Score**: Similarity across multiple generations
- **Integration Success**: How well components work together

### Learning Objectives
- **Optimal guidance level**: How much structure is helpful vs. overwhelming?
- **Package adoption patterns**: Which recommendations are followed most?
- **Design pattern effectiveness**: Which patterns improve consistency most?
- **AI decision-making**: How does AI reason about trade-offs with guidance?

This approach tests whether structured guidance and the MAX-MIN principle can significantly improve AI code generation consistency and quality compared to basic natural language specifications alone.
