# Approach 3: Verification-Enhanced Generation

> **Method**: Natural Language Specification + Design + MAX-MIN + Formal Verification → AI → Source Code  
> **Role**: Treatment group with verification feedback  
> **Goal**: Measure impact of formal verification on consistency and reliability  

## Approach Overview

This approach extends Approach 2 with formal verification requirements and feedback mechanisms. AI must generate code that passes specified verification checks, with iterative refinement based on verification results. This tests whether formal verification can further improve consistency and reliability.

## Documentation Structure

### Complete Guidance + Verification Package

The documentation for this approach includes:
- **All elements from Approach 2** (NL specs, design patterns, MAX-MIN)
- **Property specifications** for formal verification
- **Contract definitions** with preconditions and postconditions
- **Verification test suites** with property-based testing
- **Feedback mechanisms** for verification failures
- **Refinement protocols** for iterative improvement

### Components to Implement

Based on QiCore v4 documentation with formal verification:

**Base Component**:
1. **Result<T>** - Type-safe error handling with monad laws verification
2. **QiError** - Structured error representation with contract compliance

**Core Component**:
3. **Configuration** - Multi-source config loading with monoid laws verification
4. **Logger** - Simple effect interface with contract verification
5. **Cache** - High-performance caching with behavioral verification

### Verification Documentation

- All documentation from Approach 2 PLUS:
- `property-specifications.md` - Mathematical properties and invariants for QiCore v4
- `contract-definitions.md` - Preconditions, postconditions for all components
- `verification-test-suite.md` - Property-based testing for monad/monoid laws
- `feedback-protocols.md` - How to interpret verification failures
- `refinement-process.md` - Iterative improvement based on verification

## Verification Framework

### Property-Based Testing

**Mathematical Properties to Verify**:
- **Monad Laws**: Left identity, right identity, associativity
- **Functor Laws**: Identity preservation, composition preservation
- **Invariant Preservation**: State consistency across operations
- **Contract Compliance**: Precondition/postcondition adherence

**Example Property Specifications**:
```typescript
// Result<T> monad laws
property("left identity", fc.anything(), (a) => {
  const f = (x: any) => Result.success(x * 2);
  return Result.success(a).flatMap(f).equals(f(a));
});

property("right identity", fc.anything(), (a) => {
  const result = Result.success(a);
  return result.flatMap(Result.success).equals(result);
});
```

### Contract Verification

**Design by Contract Elements**:
- **Preconditions**: Input validation and requirements
- **Postconditions**: Output guarantees and state changes
- **Class Invariants**: Object consistency rules
- **Interface Contracts**: Protocol compliance verification

**Example Contract Specifications**:
```typescript
interface CacheContract {
  /**
   * @precondition key.length > 0
   * @postcondition result.isSuccess() || result.isFailure()
   * @postcondition result.isSuccess() => (value !== undefined || value === undefined)
   */
  get(key: string): Result<T | undefined>;
  
  /**
   * @precondition key.length > 0
   * @precondition ttl === undefined || ttl > 0
   * @postcondition result.isSuccess() => this.get(key).isSuccess()
   */
  set(key: string, value: T, ttl?: number): Result<void>;
}
```

### Behavioral Verification

**Equivalence Testing**:
- **Input-Output Consistency**: Same inputs produce same outputs
- **State Transition Verification**: Valid state machine behavior
- **Error Handling Consistency**: Consistent error responses
- **Performance Characteristic Verification**: Expected performance bounds

### Verification Test Suites

**Automated Verification Pipeline**:
1. **Property Tests**: Mathematical law verification
2. **Contract Tests**: Precondition/postcondition checking
3. **Behavioral Tests**: State machine and equivalence testing
4. **Integration Tests**: Cross-component interaction verification
5. **Performance Tests**: Characteristic performance verification

## Experimental Protocol

### Generation Process with Verification Loop

1. **Initial Generation**: AI generates code following Approach 2 guidance
2. **Verification Run**: Execute complete verification test suite
3. **Feedback Analysis**: Analyze verification failures and provide structured feedback
4. **Refinement**: AI refines implementation based on verification feedback
5. **Iteration**: Repeat verification-refinement cycle until all tests pass
6. **Documentation**: Record the complete refinement process

### Verification Feedback Mechanisms

**Structured Error Messages**:
```typescript
interface VerificationFailure {
  type: 'property' | 'contract' | 'behavioral' | 'performance';
  component: string;
  property: string;
  expected: string;
  actual: string;
  suggestion: string;
  examples: Array<{input: any, expected: any, actual: any}>;
}
```

**AI-Consumable Feedback Format**:
- **Clear failure descriptions** with specific examples
- **Suggested corrections** based on verification results
- **Property explanations** for mathematical law violations
- **Contract clarifications** for precondition/postcondition failures

### Required AI Deliverables

- **Initial implementation** following Approach 2 guidance
- **Verification results** analysis and understanding
- **Refinement plan** based on verification feedback
- **Final implementation** passing all verification checks
- **Process documentation** explaining refinement decisions
