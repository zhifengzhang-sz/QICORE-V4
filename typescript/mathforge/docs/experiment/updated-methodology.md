# Updated Experimental Methodology: QiCore v4 Implementation Study

> **Purpose**: Empirical study using actual QiCore v4 documentation as input  
> **Components**: Base Component (Result<T>, QiError) and Core Component (Config, Logger, Cache)  
> **Goal**: Compare AI implementation quality across three approaches using real specifications  

## Experiment Setup Using QiCore v4 Documentation

### Input Documentation Files

**Available Files** (copied to `docs/experiment/inputs/`):
- `qi.v4.class.contracts.md` (46KB, 1209 lines) - Detailed class-level contracts
- `qi.v4.component.contracts.md` (19KB, 623 lines) - Component architecture and interfaces
- `patterns.md` (10KB, 208 lines) - Design patterns and architectural guidance
- `impl.md` (14KB, 324 lines) - Implementation guidance and best practices
- `process.v2.yaml` (8KB, 230 lines) - Complete development process instructions

### Target Implementation Scope

Based on QiCore v4 component contracts, we'll implement:

**Base Component**:
- **Result<T>**: Type-safe error handling with functional composition
- **QiError**: Structured error representation with context and chaining

**Core Component** (partial):
- **Configuration**: Multi-source config loading with monoid merge semantics
- **Logger**: Simple effect interface with level-based filtering  
- **Cache**: High-performance caching with eviction policies

## Updated AI Input Specifications

TARGET COMPONENTS:
Implement the Base Component and Core Component as specified in the attached documentation.

SPECIFICATION:
[PASTE COMPLETE CONTENT FROM qi.v4.class.contracts.md]

[PASTE COMPLETE CONTENT FROM qi.v4.component.contracts.md]

Please implement these components focusing on correctness and usability.
Create a complete TypeScript implementation that satisfies all the contracts.
```

### Approach 2: Structured Guidance

**Complete AI Input**:
```
You are a senior TypeScript developer implementing components for a production system.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use TypeScript with strict mode
- Provide complete, working implementation
- Include all necessary imports and dependencies
- Write clean, maintainable code

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FROM PROCESS V2:

- Handle ALL edge cases: cache eviction, logger transports, error chaining

DELIVERABLES REQUIRED:
1. Complete implementation following all design patterns
2. Package selection justification with MAX-MIN analysis
3. Comprehensive test suite with property-based testing
4. Integration tests between components
5. Edge case coverage documentation

Focus on following the complete process guidance while producing production-quality code.
```

### Approach 3: Verification-Enhanced

**Initial Generation** (Same as Approach 2 plus):
```
ADDITIONAL VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS:
Your implementation will be tested against formal verification properties including:
- Monad laws for Result<T> (left identity, right identity, associativity)
- Functor laws for Result<T> (identity, composition)
- Monoid laws for Configuration merge operations
- Contract compliance for all component interfaces
- Integration behavior between components
- Performance characteristics as specified in contracts

Ensure your implementation can pass rigorous verification checks including:
- Property-based testing with 1000+ test cases per property
- Contract verification for preconditions and postconditions
- Behavioral consistency across component interactions
- Performance benchmarks meeting QiCore v4 specifications
```
