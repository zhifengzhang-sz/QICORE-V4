## Foundational Design Principle

**Package-First Architecture**: We maximize the usage of high-quality, battle-tested packages and minimize custom implementation in areas where excellent packages exist. Custom implementation is reserved only for areas where:

1. **Mathematical Contracts**: No existing package satisfies our specific mathematical requirements
2. **Integration Gaps**: Packages don't compose cleanly together
3. **Performance Critical**: Package overhead conflicts with performance tiers
4. **Domain-Specific Logic**: Application-specific behavior that packages cannot provide

## Core Design Logic

### 1. Error Handling Architecture

**Design Decision**: Use established functional programming library for error handling  
**Reasoning**: Error handling with monadic composition is a solved problem  
**Package Strategy**: Leverage `fp-ts` for proven Either monad implementation  
**Custom Scope**: Only error context structure and domain-specific error types  

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ **Battle-tested monad laws** - fp-ts handles mathematical correctness
- ✅ **TypeScript optimization** - Library optimized for V8 performance  
- ✅ **Ecosystem integration** - Standard in functional TypeScript codebases
- ✅ **Minimal maintenance** - We don't maintain monad implementation

### 2. Configuration Architecture

**Design Decision**: Custom monoid implementation for configuration merging  
**Reasoning**: Existing config libraries don't provide monoid semantics  
**Package Strategy**: No suitable package provides associative merge with identity  
**Custom Scope**: Monoid implementation with right-biased merge semantics  

**Why Custom Implementation**:
- ⚠ **Package Gap** - No existing library provides proper monoid laws
- ⚠ **Mathematical Requirements** - Need verified associative merge operation
- ⚠ **Precedence Control** - Right-biased merge not available in standard libraries
- ✅ **Minimal Surface Area** - Only merge logic, not parsing or loading

### 3. Logging Architecture

**Design Decision**: Use industry-standard logging library  
**Reasoning**: Logging is infrastructure, not domain logic  
**Package Strategy**: Leverage `winston` for production-grade logging  
**Custom Scope**: Only simple effect interface wrapper  

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ **Production Battle-tested** - Winston handles all logging complexities
- ✅ **Transport Ecosystem** - Rich ecosystem of log destinations
- ✅ **Performance Optimized** - Level checking and formatting optimizations
- ✅ **Maintenance Outsourced** - We don't maintain logging infrastructure

### 4. Caching Architecture

**Design Decision**: Custom memory cache with Redis integration  
**Reasoning**: No package provides LRU+TTL with Result<T> integration  
**Package Strategy**: Use `ioredis` for distributed scenarios  
**Custom Scope**: Memory cache with eviction policies, Redis wrapper for consistency  

**Why Hybrid Approach**:
- ⚠ **Package Gap** - No package provides Result<T> + LRU + TTL integration
- ✅ **Redis Expertise** - ioredis is the proven Redis client
- ⚠ **Performance Critical** - Memory cache needs sub-50μs operations
- ✅ **Consistent Interface** - Same Result<T> API for local and distributed

### 5. Performance Monitoring Architecture

**Design Decision**: Use native browser/Node.js performance APIs  
**Reasoning**: Performance measurement is platform-provided capability  
**Package Strategy**: Native `performance.now()` with minimal wrapper  
**Custom Scope**: Only statistical aggregation and tier-aware assertions  

**Why Native APIs**:
- ✅ **Zero Dependencies** - Platform provides timing capabilities
- ✅ **Maximum Precision** - Native timing is most accurate
- ✅ **No Overhead** - Direct API calls without library abstraction
- ⚠ **Custom Analytics** - Statistical analysis tailored to our performance tiers

## Architectural Patterns & Logic

### Pattern 1: Package Delegation for Standard Problems

**Philosophy**: For well-solved problems, delegate to best-in-class packages  
**Application Areas**:
- **HTTP Client**: Use established HTTP library with circuit breaker
- **JSON/YAML Parsing**: Use standard parsing libraries  
- **Cryptographic Functions**: Never implement crypto, use vetted libraries
- **Date/Time Handling**: Use proven date libraries

**Design Rule**: If a problem has a widely-accepted solution, use the leading package

### Pattern 2: Custom Implementation for Mathematical Contracts

**Philosophy**: When mathematical properties matter, custom implementation ensures correctness  
**Application Areas**:
- **Monoid Operations**: Configuration merging with verified laws
- **State Machines**: Circuit breaker with precise state transitions
- **Domain Models**: Business logic that packages cannot provide

**Design Rule**: Implement custom logic only when mathematical or domain requirements cannot be satisfied by packages

### Pattern 3: Wrapper Pattern for Integration

**Philosophy**: Create thin wrappers to integrate packages with our architectural principles  
**Application Areas**:
- **Result<T> Integration**: Wrap package errors into our error handling model
- **Effect Interface**: Provide consistent interfaces across different package implementations
- **Type Safety Bridges**: Add TypeScript safety to JavaScript packages

**Design Rule**: Minimize wrapper logic; focus on interface consistency and error handling integration

### Pattern 4: Performance-Conscious Package Selection

**Philosophy**: Package selection must consider performance tier requirements  
**Selection Criteria**:
- **Benchmark Compatibility**: Package performance aligns with our tiers
- **Memory Efficiency**: No excessive allocation in hot paths
- **Bundle Size**: Consider startup time and deployment size
- **V8 Optimization**: Packages optimized for Node.js runtime

**Design Rule**: Performance requirements can override "best package" choice

## Component Integration Logic

### Base Layer Strategy
**Purpose**: Provide mathematical foundations  
**Package Approach**: Use `fp-ts` for proven mathematical structures  
**Custom Scope**: Only domain-specific error types and contexts

### Core Layer Strategy  
**Purpose**: Provide infrastructure services  
**Package Approach**: Mix of packages (winston) and custom (config monoid)  
**Custom Scope**: Only where packages don't meet mathematical requirements

### Application Layer Strategy
**Purpose**: Provide domain-specific functionality  
**Package Approach**: Maximize package usage with integration wrappers  
**Custom Scope**: Only domain logic and integration between packages

## Decision Framework

### When to Use a Package
1. **Proven Track Record** - Package is widely adopted and maintained
2. **Mathematical Correctness** - Package satisfies our mathematical requirements
3. **Performance Compatibility** - Package meets our performance tier requirements
4. **Integration Feasibility** - Package integrates cleanly with our architecture
5. **Maintenance Burden** - Package reduces our maintenance overhead

### When to Implement Custom
1. **Mathematical Gap** - No package provides required mathematical properties
2. **Integration Complexity** - Package integration would require significant wrapper code
3. **Performance Critical** - Package overhead conflicts with performance tiers  
4. **Domain Specificity** - Logic is specific to our application domain
5. **Dependency Risk** - Package has maintenance or security concerns

### Decision Matrix Example

| Component | Package Available? | Mathematical Fit? | Performance OK? | Decision | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------|-----------|
| Error Handling | ✅ fp-ts | ✅ Either monad | ✅ V8 optimized | **Package** | Perfect fit |
| Configuration | ❌ No monoid libs | ❌ No proper laws | ✅ Would be fine | **Custom** | Mathematical gap |
| Logging | ✅ winston | ✅ Effect interface | ✅ Production grade | **Package** | Infrastructure solved |
| HTTP Client | ✅ axios/fetch | ✅ Promise-based | ✅ Battle-tested | **Package** | Standard solution |
