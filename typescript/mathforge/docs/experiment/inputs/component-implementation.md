# Component Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step implementation instructions for the 5 QiCore v4 components: Result, QiError, Configuration, Logger, and Cache.

## Component 1: Result<T>

### Implementation Strategy
- Use fp-ts Either as the foundation
- Provide factory functions for success/failure cases
- Implement monad operations (map, flatMap)

### Key Requirements
- All operations must be pure functions
- Support chaining operations
- Integrate with QiError for failures
- Performance target: <100μs per operation

### Implementation Pattern
```typescript
import { Either, left, right } from 'fp-ts/Either';

export const Result = {
  success: <T>(value: T): Either<QiError, T> => right(value),
  failure: <T>(error: QiError): Either<QiError, T> => left(error),
  // ... additional operations
};
```

## Component 2: QiError

### Implementation Strategy
- Custom immutable error structure
- Support context chaining
- Enable error cause tracking

### Key Requirements
- Include error code, message, category
- Support additional context data
- Be serializable for logging
- Support error cause chaining

## Component 3: Configuration

### Implementation Strategy
- Custom monoid implementation
- Support multiple loading sources
- Right-biased merge semantics

### Key Requirements
- Implement monoid laws (associativity, identity)
- Support file, environment, object sources
- Return Result<T> for all operations
- Performance target: <1ms per merge

## Component 4: Logger

### Implementation Strategy
- Wrap Winston with effect interface
- Optimize for performance
- Integrate with Configuration

### Key Requirements
- Support DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR levels
- Accept structured context data
- Performance target: <1μs level check
- Handle transport failures gracefully

## Component 5: Cache

### Implementation Strategy
- Custom memory cache with LRU+TTL
- Support both sync and async operations
- Integrate with Redis for distributed scenarios

### Key Requirements
- LRU eviction policy
- TTL expiration with cleanup
- Return Result<T> for all operations
- Performance target: <50μs per operation

## Integration Requirements

### Cross-Component Integration
- All components use QiError for error reporting
- All fallible operations return Result<T>
- Logger accepts Configuration for initialization
- Cache uses Logger for operational logging

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests between components
- Property-based tests for mathematical laws
- Edge case coverage for all components
- Target: 85%+ test coverage with 300+ tests
