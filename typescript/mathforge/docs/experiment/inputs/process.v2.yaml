# Experiment v1 Lessons Learned
lessons_learned:
  agent_strengths:
    - "Excellent mathematical pattern recognition"
    - "High-quality code architecture"
    - "Perfect QiCore integration"
    - "Good performance optimization"
  
  agent_weaknesses:
    - "Incomplete component coverage (missed Cache/Logger tests)"
    - "No integration testing"
    - "Limited edge case coverage"
    - "Focused on mathematical components, ignored practical ones"
  
  process_gaps:
    - "Documentation didn't emphasize COMPLETENESS"
    - "No explicit checklist of components to implement/test"
    - "Integration testing not specified"
    - "Edge case examples not provided"
  
  key_insight: "Agents excel at mathematical correctness but need explicit guidance for completeness"
