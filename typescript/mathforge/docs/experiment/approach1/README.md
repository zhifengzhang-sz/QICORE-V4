# Approach 1: Basic AI Generation

> **Method**: Natural Language Specification → AI → Source Code  
> **Role**: Control group with minimal guidance  
> **Goal**: Establish baseline for comparison  

## Approach Overview

This approach provides only natural language specifications to AI, with minimal guidance on implementation details, design patterns, or package selection. This serves as our control group to measure the impact of structured guidance.

## Documentation Structure

### Natural Language Specifications Only

The documentation for this approach includes:
- **What** the component should do (functional requirements)
- **Basic interface** requirements (inputs/outputs)
- **Error conditions** that must be handled
- **No guidance** on how to implement
- **No package recommendations**
- **No design pattern suggestions**

### Components to Implement

Based on QiCore v4 documentation:

**Base Component**:
1. **Result<T>** - Type-safe error handling with functional composition
2. **QiError** - Structured error representation with context and chaining

**Core Component**:
3. **Configuration** - Multi-source config loading with monoid merge semantics
4. **Logger** - Simple effect interface with level-based filtering
5. **Cache** - High-performance caching with eviction policies

**Input Documentation**: 
- `qi.v4.class.contracts.md` (46KB, 1209 lines)
- `qi.v4.component.contracts.md` (19KB, 623 lines)

## Experimental Protocol

### Generation Process
1. Provide only the natural language specification
2. Ask AI to implement the component
3. Accept first reasonable implementation
4. Record the generation process and decisions made
5. Repeat 5 times for each component

### What NOT to Provide
- Package recommendations
- Design pattern guidance
- Architecture constraints
- Implementation hints
- Code examples or templates
- Performance requirements beyond basic functionality

### Data Collection
- Generated code for analysis
- AI reasoning and decision-making process
- Package choices made by AI
- Implementation patterns chosen
- Time to generate
- Any questions AI asks during generation

## Expected Outcomes

### Predicted Characteristics
- **High variability** across generations
- **Custom implementations** rather than package usage
- **Inconsistent patterns** across components
- **Basic functionality** focus
- **Minimal error handling** sophistication

### Metrics to Track
- **Consistency**: How similar are multiple generations?
- **Package Usage**: What packages does AI choose independently?
- **Code Quality**: Maintainability and best practices
- **Completeness**: How well does it meet the specification?
- **Error Handling**: Robustness of error scenarios

This approach establishes our baseline to measure the value of structured guidance and formal verification in subsequent approaches.
