# Result<T> Component Specification

## Overview

Implement a Result type that can represent either a successful value or an error. This is commonly used for error handling without throwing exceptions.

## Requirements

### Basic Functionality
- The Result type should be able to hold either a success value of type T or an error
- Provide a way to create successful results
- Provide a way to create error results
- Allow checking whether a result represents success or failure
- Allow extracting the value from successful results
- Allow extracting error information from failed results

### Operations
- Support mapping over successful values (transform the value if success, leave errors unchanged)
- Support chaining operations that might fail (if current result is success, apply the operation; if failure, propagate the error)
- Support providing default values for failed results

### Error Information
- Errors should include a message describing what went wrong
- Errors should include some kind of error code or category
- Errors should be structured enough to be useful for debugging

### Usage Examples
The Result type should support usage patterns like:
- Creating a successful result with a value
- Creating a failed result with error information
- Checking if a result is successful or failed
- Getting the value from a successful result
- Getting error information from a failed result
- Transforming successful values while preserving failures
- Chaining operations that might fail
- Providing fallback values for failures

## Interface Requirements

The component should be usable in TypeScript and provide type safety. The exact interface design is up to the implementation, but it should support the functionality described above in a clean and intuitive way.
