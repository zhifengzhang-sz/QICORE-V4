COMPONENT TO IMPLEMENT: [COMPONENT_NAME]
```

### Approach 1: Basic AI Input

**Complete Prompt Template**:
```
[STANDARD_PREFIX]

SPECIFICATION:
[PASTE_COMPLETE_SPEC_FROM_approach1/component-spec.md]

Please implement this component focusing on correctness and usability.
```

**Example for Result<T>**:
```
[STANDARD_PREFIX]

SPECIFICATION:
# Result<T> Component Specification

## Overview
Implement a Result type that can represent either a successful value or an error. This is commonly used for error handling without throwing exceptions.

## Requirements
### Basic Functionality
- The Result type should be able to hold either a success value of type T or an error
- Provide a way to create successful results
- Provide a way to create error results
- Allow checking whether a result represents success or failure
- Allow extracting the value from successful results
- Allow extracting error information from failed results

### Operations
- Support mapping over successful values (transform the value if success, leave errors unchanged)
- Support chaining operations that might fail (if current result is success, apply the operation; if failure, propagate the error)
- Support providing default values for failed results

### Error Information
- Errors should include a message describing what went wrong
- Errors should include some kind of error code or category
- Errors should be structured enough to be useful for debugging

### Usage Examples
The Result type should support usage patterns like:
- Creating a successful result with a value
- Creating a failed result with error information
- Checking if a result is successful or failed
- Getting the value from a successful result
- Getting error information from a failed result
- Transforming successful values while preserving failures
- Chaining operations that might fail
- Providing fallback values for failures

## Interface Requirements
The component should be usable in TypeScript and provide type safety. The exact interface design is up to the implementation, but it should support the functionality described above in a clean and intuitive way.

Please implement this component focusing on correctness and usability.
```

### Approach 2: Structured Guidance Input

**Complete Prompt Template**:
```
[STANDARD_PREFIX]

You must follow these comprehensive guidelines:

FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION:
[PASTE_COMPLETE_SPEC_FROM_approach2/component-guided-spec.md]

DESIGN CONSTRAINTS:
- Follow functional programming patterns (immutable data, pure functions)
- Implement proper error handling with structured error types
- Use composition over inheritance
- Ensure type safety throughout

MAX-MIN PRINCIPLE (CRITICAL):
- MAXIMIZE usage of battle-tested packages for complex functionality
- MINIMIZE custom implementation, especially for edge cases
- Justify every custom implementation decision
- Prefer established patterns and community standards

PACKAGE RECOMMENDATIONS:
For Result<T> implementation, evaluate these packages:
1. fp-ts/Either - Battle-tested functional programming library
2. neverthrow - TypeScript-specific Result type
3. ts-results - Lightweight Result implementation

QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- 100% TypeScript with strict mode
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear documentation and examples
- Performance considerations
- Integration with modern tooling

REQUIRED DELIVERABLES:
1. Complete implementation following all guidelines
2. Package selection justification
3. MAX-MIN analysis (what you used packages for vs custom code)
4. Quality checklist verification
5. Integration plan with other components

Focus on consistency, quality, and following the provided guidance exactly.
```

### Approach 3: Verification-Enhanced Input

**Initial Generation Phase** (Same as Approach 2):
```
[APPROACH_2_COMPLETE_PROMPT]

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT:
Your implementation will be tested against formal verification properties including:
- Mathematical laws (monad laws, functor laws)
- Contract compliance (preconditions, postconditions)
- Behavioral consistency
- Property-based testing

Ensure your implementation can pass rigorous verification checks.
```

**Refinement Phase Prompt Template**:
```
Your implementation failed the following verification checks:

FAILED PROPERTIES:
[SPECIFIC_PROPERTY_FAILURES]

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
```json
{
  "component": "Result<T>",
  "failures": [
    {
      "type": "property",
      "property": "monad_left_identity",
      "expected": "Result.success(a).flatMap(f) should equal f(a)",
      "actual": "Different behavior observed",
      "examples": [
        {"input": 42, "expected": "Success(84)", "actual": "Success(42)"}
      ],
      "suggestion": "Check flatMap implementation - may not be applying function correctly"
    }
  ]
}
```

Please refine your implementation to pass all verification checks.
Explain what changes you made and why they address the failures.
```
