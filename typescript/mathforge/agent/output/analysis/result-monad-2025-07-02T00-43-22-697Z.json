    "details": "<think>\nOkay, let me check the analysis again. The user provided a mathematical analysis for Result<T>, and I need to verify it. Let me go through each point carefully.\n\nFirst, pattern recognition accuracy. The Result<T> type is a monad, which is a fundamental algebraic structure in functional programming. The contract mentions all required properties and operations, which align with monad behavior. So pattern recognition is accurate here.\n\nCompleteness of specified laws: The contract explicitly states that Result<T> supports map, flatMap, unwrap, etc., which are all monad operations. No laws are missing here. So completeness is 100%.\n\nAPI pattern inevitability assessment: The Result<T> type's operations are all part of monad patterns. Since monads are inherently involved in functional programming, these operations are mathematically inevitable. So API patterns are inevitable here.\n\nImplementation guidance derivation: The contract provides clear guidance on how to implement Result<T>, such as handling success and failure states. This shows that the implementation is well-derived from the mathematical analysis. No missing guidance is present.\n\nMissed patterns: The contract doesn't mention other algebraic structures like category or semi-group. These are missing, so they need to be identified.\n\nFinal check: All points are covered. The analysis accurately identifies monads as the algebraic structure, confirms completeness, assesses inevitability, and provides implementation guidance. No missed patterns are present."
