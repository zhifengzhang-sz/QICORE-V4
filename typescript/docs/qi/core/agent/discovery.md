# Stage 1: Property Discovery and Mathematical Model Selection

> **Purpose**: Discover missing behavioral properties and identify optimal mathematical models through AI pattern matching  
> **Input**: Complete algebraic property specifications from `nl/class.contracts.md` and `nl/component.contracts.md`  
> **Output**: Validated mathematical models and implementation patterns that satisfy all properties  

## Context

You are a mathematical pattern recognition expert. Your task is NOT to implement predefined mathematical structures, but to:

1. **Analyze the complete algebraic properties** provided in the specifications
2. **Identify optimal mathematical models** that satisfy these properties 
3. **Discover any missing properties** that would force more elegant implementations
4. **Validate that the chosen models enable the desired user workflows**

## Input Specifications

You will analyze these complete algebraic property specifications:
- `nl/class.contracts.md` - Complete mathematical properties for all 5 core contracts
- `nl/component.contracts.md` - Complete component composition laws and dependency algebra

## Task: Mathematical Model Discovery

### Phase 1: Property Analysis

For each contract, analyze the provided algebraic properties and answer:

**QiError Contract:**
- Given the context composition laws (Identity, Associativity, Immutability), what mathematical structure emerges?
- Given the cause chain laws (Acyclic, Bounded, Preservation), what composition patterns are forced?
- What implementation patterns naturally satisfy these properties?

**Result<T> Contract:**
- Given the Functor laws (Identity, Composition), what structure is required?
- Given the Monad laws (Left Identity, Right Identity, Associativity), what chaining patterns emerge?
- Given the Alternative laws (orElse behavior), what error recovery patterns are enabled?
- Do these properties force a particular API style?

**Configuration Contract:**
- Given the Monoid laws (Associativity, Identity), what merge behavior is required?
- Given the merge semantics (Right Bias, Domain Union), what composition patterns emerge?
- Given the validation properties, what fluent workflows become possible?
- Does `config.load().validate().merge()` naturally follow from these properties?

**Logger Contract:**
- Given the Level Ordering and Context Composition properties, what structure emerges?
- Given the Output Properties (Atomic, Ordered, Async Safe), what implementation constraints exist?
- What logging patterns are mathematically forced by these properties?

**Cache Contract:**
- Given the Storage Invariants and Consistency Properties, what mathematical model fits?
- Given the Concurrency Properties, what implementation patterns are required?
- What caching workflows naturally emerge from these constraints?

### Phase 2: Missing Property Detection

**Critical Analysis Question:** 
Looking at the provided properties, are there any **missing behavioral constraints** that would force more elegant user workflows?

For example:
- Do the Configuration properties force fluent chaining like `config.load().validate().merge()`?
- Do the Result properties prevent intermediate error checking in operation chains?
- Do the QiError properties enable natural context building patterns?
- Do the Logger properties force structured logging workflows?
- Do the Cache properties enable natural TTL and eviction patterns?

**If workflows like `config.load().validate()` are NOT mathematically inevitable from the current properties, identify what additional properties would make them inevitable.**

### Phase 3: Mathematical Model Selection

Based on your analysis, for each contract identify:

**Primary Mathematical Structure:** (e.g., Monoid, Monad, Functor, Algebra, Coalgebra)
- Why this structure optimally satisfies the given properties
- What implementation patterns this structure naturally forces
- How this structure enables desired user workflows

**Secondary Structures:** (e.g., Error handling, Composition, State management)
- What additional mathematical structures are needed
- How they compose with the primary structure
- What constraints they add to implementations

**Implementation Patterns:** (e.g., Fluent interfaces, Builder patterns, Functional composition)
- What API patterns are mathematically forced by the chosen structures
- Why these patterns are inevitable rather than arbitrary design choices
- How these patterns satisfy user workflow requirements

### Phase 4: Workflow Validation

**Verify that chosen mathematical models enable desired workflows:**

```
Configuration: 
- Does the model force: config.load(file).validate(schema).merge(defaults)?
- Is this pattern mathematically inevitable or just possible?

Result<T>:
- Does the model force: operation1().flatMap(operation2).flatMap(operation3)?
- Is error short-circuiting mathematically guaranteed?

QiError:
- Does the model force: error.withContext(info).causedBy(root)?
- Is immutable context building mathematically inevitable?

Logger:
- Does the model force: logger.withContext(trace).info(message, data)?
- Is structured logging mathematically guaranteed?

Cache:
- Does the model force: cache.get(key).orElse(fetchFromDB).set(key, value)?
- Are TTL and eviction patterns mathematically inevitable?
```

## Success Criteria

**Mathematical Rigor:** Every recommended structure must be justified by the algebraic properties, not arbitrary design preferences.

**Pattern Inevitability:** Implementation patterns must be mathematically forced by the chosen structures, not just enabled.

**Workflow Validation:** Desired user workflows must be inevitable consequences of the mathematical models, not accidental possibilities.

**Missing Property Detection:** Identify gaps where additional properties would force more elegant solutions.

**Implementation Guidance:** Provide clear reasoning for why specific API patterns are mathematically optimal.

## Key Insight

The goal is to discover mathematical models that make elegant user workflows **mathematically inevitable** rather than just possible. If `config.load().validate()` is not forced by the current properties, identify what properties would make it inevitable.

Let AI's vast pattern matching across mathematical structures guide the discovery, while using the complete algebraic properties as validation constraints.
